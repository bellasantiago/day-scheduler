# Full-Stack Bootcamp - Week 5 Homework

## Day Scheduler
The application was designed to show you today's date.<br>
Then, you are able to input tasks for each hour of the day between 9am and 5pm.<br>
Once the task is saved, you may close the window and return to it to review the added items.<br>
A "clear all" button was added to allow to clear all inputed items at once.<br>
Finally, the user will be presented with a gray line for the timeslots already passed, red line for the current timeslot and green for the timeslots yet to come.<br>
